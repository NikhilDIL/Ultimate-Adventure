Ultimate Adventure is a strategy game where there are two teams known as the heroes and the enemies. There are three characters on each team. Players take turns controlling the characters on the battlefield to eliminate all characters of the opposing team using the surroundings on the map and the character's unique abilities and attacks.

The UI has five buttons which are the attack, defense, special skill, and strong attack buttons. You can select characters on the battlefield by clicking on them. You can move these characters using the w,a,s,d keys. When you  want to perform an attack, simply click on the enemy unit that you want to attack and click the attack button. If the enemy is in the attacker's range, then the attack will successfully go through and deal damage. Characters also have a variety of other buttons at their disposal such as defense which increases the characters defense power and special skill which grants them extra attack or some other stat boost.
